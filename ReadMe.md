# Big Fishing Profile

This profile set is designed to catch all Big Fish until level 80.

## Setup

Before you start, open the Start.xml and set all fish you want catch to 1, all other fish to 0.

Make sure you have completed your gatherer and crafter up through level 80 to start.

You will need ExBuddy installed in your plugins folder which can be found here https://github.com/Entrax643/ExBuddy
You will need to take the ExTurnInGuildLeveTag.cs file from my Plugins folder and place it in RebornBuddy\Plugins\ExBuddy\OrderBotTags\Behaviors folder, overwriting the current one. This files makes some changes to fix the GuildLeve turn ins.

You will also need the latest version of LlamaLibrary installed in your botbases folder which can be found here https://github.com/nt153133/LlamaLibrary
(Make sure you update before running the profiles, Kayla is constantly making new tags for this set and you'll need the absolute latest.)

I'm in the process of changing over all the movement in this profile to be handled by Lisbeth. Saga's new Sextant 2.0 is far suprior to anything else RebornBuddy has to offer and makes for a much smoother questing experience. As such, you will need Lisbeth to make these profiles work. If you don't have it, you can find it here: https://www.siune.io/
